# Spatial index java
Implementation of spatial indexing algorithms in java. At the moment, only an r-tree index is implemented by this project.

## Features of the R-tree implementation
* Supports rectangle geometries
* Supports n-dimensional data
* Support serializing to file
* Can be used as in-memory data structure
* R-Tree can be serialized and accessed via _memory mapped io_. This is usefull for very large datasets.

## Example
```java
